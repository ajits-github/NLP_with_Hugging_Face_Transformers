# NLP_with_Hugging_Face_Transformers
A project where we see different machine learning algorithms in use with Hugging face pre-trained models 

Scope of the project:
* Review of machine learning (ML) for natural language processing (NLP)
* Introduction to transformers and their architectures
* Introduction to Hugging Face
* Using pre-trained transformers from Hugging Face for:
    - Sentiment analysis
    - Named entity recognition
    - Question-Answering(Qu-An)
    - SQuAD metric
    - Text Summarization
    - Natural Language Generation
    - The ROUGE score
    - Customizing models with Transfer Learning
    - Deployment
